<p>Eu achei o pdf de FATAL...</p>
<p>eis o que acabo lendo:</p>
<p>"The anakim may fart as loud as thunder. Â All creatures within a 10-feet radius of this anakim, except the anakim, automatically take 1d4 sonic damage and are stunned for 1 round, which can be avoided by passing a Drive check at TH 17. This can be utilized only once per week."</p>
