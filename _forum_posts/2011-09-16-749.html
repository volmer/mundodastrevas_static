<p>Coming home after a long, long war<br />Coming home after a dozen of walks<br />Coming home after a long, long war<br />Coming home after a dozen of wars<br /><br />We are out of wind<br />We have pock-marked chin<br />We have lots of water<br />We turn the other cheek and we win<br /><br />One thousand stories and soon there's more<br />We've been offered one more lap to go<br />In my hand I hold a key<br />It's dear to me cause I know where it leads<br /><br />We are out of wind<br />We have pock-marked chin<br />We have all this water<br />We turn the other cheek with a grin</p>
