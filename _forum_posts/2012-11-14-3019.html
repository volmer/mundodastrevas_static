como eu traduzo &nbsp; Tells como titulo do texto ;<br><div>Tells</div><div>Tells are derangements that relate directly to the hunt.</div><div>While they may, in their more severe forms, intrude upon the</div><div>hunter’s non-Vigil activities, situations and thought processes,</div><div>they are always a direct result of a change in the hunter’s</div><div>Code and tie into her Vigil in some way. Psychologically, Tells</div><div>represent the damage that breaking from mainstream humanity’s</div><div>Morality causes in an individual. As such, they begin as</div><div>minor derangements, but as the hunter’s Code grows progressively</div><div>different from that of “normal” humans, her Tells grow</div><div>(either deeper or greater in number, or both) until the hunter</div><div>is as morally different from normal humanity as the creatures</div><div>she hunts.</div><div>Unless otherwise specifi ed, Tells potentially manifest</div><div>during stressful moments on the Vigil. At which point, the</div><div>character must succeed on a Resolve + Composure roll or</div><div>otherwise manifest the Tell as described.</div>
