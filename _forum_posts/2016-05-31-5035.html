Marcio o elemento borrado dos vampiros talvez tenha sido mantido, segue o trecho de onde retirei essa informação:<br><br><span>"The Thief’s actions immediately draw the ire of every vampire&nbsp;<span>who wants to remain hidden, and sometimes even draws the&nbsp;<span>attention of other supernatural creatures who don’t want to&nbsp;<span>see the doors of truth about the hidden world thrown wide.&nbsp;<span>In his natural form, he’s difficult to track down and combat,&nbsp;<span>since he flees direct conflict unless it would force vampires to&nbsp;<span>reveal their nature in public. The Thief will not hesitate to steal&nbsp;<span>a vampire’s body and is clever at remaining hidden, until the&nbsp;<span>time comes to drag a staked victim into the middle of a sunny&nbsp;<span>and well-populated street. He will also lead hunters to vampire&nbsp;<span>havens, but only when he can be assured the information will&nbsp;be spread somehow, filmed on digital camera and put on the&nbsp;Internet for the world to see. With the dawn of the information&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
<span>age, the Thief thought the latter method would be a surefire way&nbsp;<span>to break the Masquerade, but the advent of easily-faked film and&nbsp;<span>video and the sheer jaded skepticism of the Internet-going world&nbsp;<span>has disappointed those hopes. <b>One small blessing in disguise&nbsp;</b><b>is the blurring effect vampires have on film."<br></b></span></span></span></span><br>Esse trecho veio da parte das Gallery of Horror do 5 capitulo<br><br>
