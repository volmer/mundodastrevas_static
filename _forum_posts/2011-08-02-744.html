<p><strong>Little Wing</strong> - <strong>Hendrix</strong></p>
<p>Well, she's walking through the clouds<br /> with a circus mind<br />that's running round.<br />Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams<br />and fairy tales,</p>
<p>That's all she ever thinks about ...</p>
<p>Riding with the wind.</p>
<p>When I'm sad, she comes to me<br /> with a thousand smiles.<br />She gives to me free.</p>
<p>It's alright, she said,<br /> it's alright.<br />Take anything you want from me,<br />You can take anything, anything.</p>
<p>Fly on, little wing<br />Yeah, yeah, yeah, little wing...</p>
<p>----</p>
<p><strong>Spirit Crusher – Death</strong></p>
<p>It comes from the depths<br /> of a place unknown to the<br /> keeper of dreams<br /> if it could then it would steal<br /> the sun and the moon from the sky<br /> beware<br /> <br /> Human at sight, monster at heart<br /> don't let it inside it could<br /> tear you right apart</p>
<p>When it's time to feed to fulfill<br /> the need to consume a breath<br /> some will rise standing tall<br /> breathing out all the breath from<br /> the voice of a soul.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p><strong>The Prize of Beauty – My Dying Bride</strong></p>
<p>She waits for me in my dreams.<br /> Every night misery brings.<br /> Haunts my day. Haunts my wake.<br /> Oh, my lord can't you feel her grow,<br /> inside of me. Tearing my mind.<br /> For once my lord please help me<br /> Believe in you.</p>
